        <h3>Description and how to play:</h3>
                <!--first paragraph-->
        <p class="makePSmaller">The game you are going to play is called "Memory Game" as you can pretty much see this name everywhere on the page. This game tests your ability to remeber where specific
            cards are placed which then you will have to match them between each other.    
        </p>
                <!--second paragraph-->
        <p class="makePSmaller">
            To able to play this game you will need a mouse. You will be given 16 cards that are facing down. You will have to click on a card which will then show an image.
            After that, you must click on a different card which will show you the same image or a different one. If the two cards facing up match, then they will remain like that.
            If not, they will go back to their first state. You must match all the cards in order to finish the game. There will be a timer which will act as a score. At the end of
            the game, the time will be displayed in the Highscore page starting from the fastest time to the slowest.
